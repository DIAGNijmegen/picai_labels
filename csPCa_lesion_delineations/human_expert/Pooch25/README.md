# Prostate Cancer MRI Segmentation Annotations

This repository contains expert-delineated annotations for aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason Grade Group â‰¥ 2) on bi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (bpMRI). These annotations were generated as part of the study:

**[Semi-Supervised Learning in Prostate MRI Tumor Segmentation Approaches Fully-Supervised Performance on External Validation](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2025/05/13/2025.05.13.25327456)**

The annotations were used in the training of the fully-supervised model curretly ranking first in the *Open Development Phase - Testing Leaderboard* of the PI-CAI challenge [https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/nnunet-suponly-fl/](https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/nnunet-suponly-fl/).

These annotations are being made publicly available to facilitate further research and development in the field of medical image analysis, particularly for prostate cancer detection and segmentation.

## Data Description

The annotations provided in this repository correspond to a subset of the PI-CAI challenge dataset. This directory contains **205 newly created manual annotations** on images that were originally AI-annotated in the PI-CAI training set.
